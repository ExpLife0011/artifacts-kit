For LoadLibrary PE hollow, moating = REALIGNED and header wiping = VIRTUAL. Moating + header wiping = VIRTUAL

For PRV PE bootstrap, moating = VIRTUAL, header wiping = UNMAPPED, moating + header wipe = VIRTUAL

For PRV, +RX vs +RWX makes no difference for blank, shellcode or PE.
For MAP, +RX vs +RWX makes no difference for blank, shellcode or PE.

The most interesting takeaways are:
1. Only phantom DLLs are detected blank
2. All variations of PE bootstrap are detected except hollowing in a .NET module in the PEB
3. Even with header wiping and moating, PEs in PRV/MAP memory are detected, but shellcode never is even when non-moated.
