malfind does not catch any test cases besides mapped shellcode.
It was confirmed correct permissions and tests. Moneta verified the memory is +RX, not +RWX. Fascinatingly, it seems that because mapped was initially +RWX it triggers detection
for shellcode but NOT PE (confirmed this).

It only seems to catch mapped and private +RWX memory regions, and does not catch them blank.
